- "strengths: code was very detailed and answered questions clearly, facilitated discussions and kept us engaged, availability outside of class (office hours, email, piazza) weaknesses: nothing at this time."
- "Hikaru is a lifesaver! She was always happy to meet outside of section to go over issues with code and the class in general and she was really good at explaining some of the nuances of the code to someone who is not familiar with R at all."
