    <li>Selected student feedback:</li>
    <blockquote>
    <q>Hikaru did really well with a very tough job to try to teach us a lot of coding in a very short period of time. She is also kind and easily reachable.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
    <q>strengths: code was very detailed and answered questions clearly, facilitated discussions and kept us engaged, availability outside of class (office hours, email, piazza) weaknesses: nothing at this time</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
    <q>Hikaru is a lifesaver! She was always happy to meet outside of section to go over issues with code and the class in general and she was really good at explaining some of the nuances of the code to someone who is not familiar with R at all.</q>
