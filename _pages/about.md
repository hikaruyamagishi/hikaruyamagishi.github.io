I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs](https://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/us-japan/people/people-categories/2022â€“23) and an affiliate at the [Weatherhead Research Cluster on Business and Government](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/wrc22-business-and-government).

My research focuses on electoral competition, primarily within frameworks of comparative politics and comparative political economy. I am interested in how democratic institutions, shaping individual incentives through the contours defined by the rules of the game, influence representational and economic landscapes. My most recently published work examines the outcome of gender balance in cabinets (with Jacob Nyrup and Stuart Bramwell, forthcoming from _American Political Science Review_).

I apply a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, combining strategies such as direct observation, interviews, historical analysis, experimental designs, and statistical methods. The training I received before grad school enhances my approach, for instance, when examining the case of Japan or studying fiscal and financial politics in advanced industrialized countries. Before graduate school, I worked on a fixed-income trading floor (interest rates and derivatives) at a Japanese investment bank in New York City, covering global central banks and Japanese institutional investors. I received a Master of Arts degree in East Asian Studies from Yale and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies from Dartmouth College.
