I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs](https://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/us-japan/people/people-categories/2022â€“23). I am also affiliated with the [Weatherhead Research Cluster on Business and Government](https://wcfia.harvard.edu/weatherhead-clusters/22-business-and-government).

My research focuses on the causes and consequences of political party competition, with a special  interest in the case of Japan. My research mixes qualitative and quantitative strategies, combining methods such as direct observation, interviews, historical analysis, and survey experiments. 

My work is supported by the [Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at Harvard](https://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/us-japan/home), [Asia Society](https://asiasociety.org/), the [Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership](https://www.cgp.org/), the [Council on East Asian Studies at Yale University](https://ceas.yale.edu/), and the [Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale](https://macmillan.yale.edu/).

Before graduate school, I worked on a fixed-income trading floor at a Japanese investment bank in New York City. I was on the interest rates sales desk, and our group covered global central banks and Japanese institutional investors. I received a Master of Arts degree in East Asian Studies from Yale and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies from Dartmouth College.
