I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs](https://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/us-japan/people/people-categories/2022â€“23) and an affiliate at the [Weatherhead Research Cluster on Business and Government](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/wrc22-business-and-government).

My research focuses on democratic institutions and electoral competition, with a special interest in the case of Japan. My current work examines representative consequences such as one-party dominance in Japan and [gender balance in cabinets](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4052720) (R&R at the _American Political Science Review_). I apply a mix qualitative and quantitative methods, combining strategies such as direct observation, interviews, historical analysis, experimental designs, and statistical methods.
%I have been particularly interested in the measurement of phenomena often developed in Western political science in non-U.S. contexts.

My work is supported by the [Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at Harvard](https://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/us-japan/home), [Asia Society](https://asiasociety.org/), the [Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership](https://www.cgp.org/), the [Council on East Asian Studies at Yale University](https://ceas.yale.edu/), and the [Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale](https://macmillan.yale.edu/).

Before graduate school, I worked on a fixed-income trading floor at a Japanese investment bank in New York City. I was on the interest rates sales desk, and our group covered global central banks and Japanese institutional investors. I received a Master of Arts degree in East Asian Studies from Yale and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies from Dartmouth College.
