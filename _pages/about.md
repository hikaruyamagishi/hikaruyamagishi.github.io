I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs](https://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/us-japan/people/people-categories/2022â€“23).

My research focuses on the causes and consequences of democratic party competition, with a focus on comparative political economy and the case of Japan. My research methods mix qualitative and quantitative strategies. In my dissertation, I combine methods such as direct observation, interviews, and survey experiments to examine patterns of democratic representation.

My work is supported by the [Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at Harvard](https://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/us-japan/home), [Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership](https://www.cgp.org/), the [Council on East Asian Studies at Yale University](https://ceas.yale.edu/), the [Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale](https://macmillan.yale.edu/).

Before graduate school, I worked on a fixed-income trading floor at a Japanese investment bank in New York City. I was on the interest rates sales desk, and our group covered global central banks and Japanese institutional investors. I received a Master of Arts degree in East Asian Studies from Yale and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies from Dartmouth College.
