I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Yale University studying comparative politics and comparative political economy. I have a special interest in Japan, where I examine various realizations of my core theoretical interest, economic and political market failure. My dissertation explores the causes and consequences of one such example in the context of political party competition: problems of opposition coordination. My research is multi-method.

My work is supported by the [Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership](https://www.cgp.org/), the [Council on East Asian Studies at Yale University](https://ceas.yale.edu/), and the [Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale](https://macmillan.yale.edu/).

Before graduate school, I worked on a fixed-income trading floor at a Japanese investment bank in New York City. I was on the interest rates sales desk, and our group covered global central banks and Japanese institutional investors. I received an M.A. in East Asian Studies from Yale and an A.B. from Dartmouth College (Asian and Middle Eastern Studies; Government).
